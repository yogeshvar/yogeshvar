## Read me...

A human being still wandering in which specialisation I would fall in love with (Machine Learning or BlockChain or Software Development or Data Scientist), yet have an ever-lasting love for programming and fonts on a black screen. I like to learn and explore new technologies. I possess proven communication skills and a strong work ethic. In my spare time I'm interested in tech, AI, Gaming, Football, and Cooking.
